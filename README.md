# tensorflow_app
My Tensorflow application to detect plant diseases using a TFLite model.

The TF model is hosted in a server served using a REST API, developed using flask.
The model is hosted on the local machine.
The model is a VGG16 model trained on the plant village dataset, obtained from Kaggle.
